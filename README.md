# Pics World
Pics World is one of Tangibles Worlds universes. This is a completely new version of the old world. This version is more light, reactive and clean.

Tangibles Worlds is an experiment that offers an experience of sensory immersion. The combination of visual, sound and touch leads the user beyond a simple observation, but create the feeling of a full immersion in a parallel universe. We intervene in this new universe by touching it. The tactile experience is fundamental because becomes the catalyst, that change all the facets of the virtual reality in which the user's placed. What we perceive from the outside, doesn’t represent what we live inside the virtual world.

The installation is composed of one box. The box contains an IR distance sensor, which detects when a hand is inserted and display the virtual world which will surrounds the user. A sensor is placed on each wall within the boxes, this sensor recognizes the hand and activates an animation inside the virtual world. I tried to map the sensors in the virtual universe so that a little clue is given to the user and will lead him to trigger the animations. The entire tactile and visual experience is automatically controlled in the Oculus Rift.

My experiment involves the use of one IR distance sensors, one motion sensor, one LED, four photocell sensors and one Oculus Rift.
